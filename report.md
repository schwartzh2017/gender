# Introduction 
Compare JK Rowling's object and subject frequencies for feminine and masculine personal pronouns when she is writing as herself or her pseudonym, Robert Galbraith.  

# Methodology
1. I will download comparable number of words between her Harry Potter series and her "Robert Galbraith" books 
    - pre-2013 because that is when she was outed (NPR, 2015). 
    - Find PDFs
        - The Cuckoo's Calling (https://worldfabibooks.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-cuckoo_s-calling-robert-galbraith-j-k-rowling.pdf)
            - downloaded pgs 7-384
            - used https://www.pdfagile.com/online/pdf-to-txt to convert to txt
            - find word count ("wc cuckoos_calling_text.txt") = 16373
        - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (https://docenti.unimc.it/antonella.pascali/teaching/2018/19055/files/ultima-lezione/harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone)
            - downloaded 2-250
            - repeat steps above
            - word count = 11113
        - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (https://www.hasanboy.uz/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets.pdf)
            - downloaded 7-251
            - repeated steps above
            - word count = 10085
    - used flesch reading score to determine reading level
        - on scale of 1-100
        - used https://readabilityformulas.com/readability-scoring-system.php
        - uploaded txt files that reduced it to 3500 words
        - had it process random sample
        - repeated 3x, found avg 
            - Cuckoo's Calling = 66.67
                - 59
                - 64
                - 77
            - HP 1 = 81.33
                - 79
                - 87
                - 78
            - HP 2 = 76 
                - 77
                - 76
                - 75
    - have to get similar level reading- add more words from HP? since linear scale
